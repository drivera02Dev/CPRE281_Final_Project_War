# This is the CPRE 281 Final Project which is the classic card game of war

Instead of using cards random numbers will be assigned using the seven segment displays on the FPGA board

They will then keep track of who is winning until a certain number of points is reached then a winner will be declared

This was created with Verilog, Quartus Prime, and QuestaSim

My main role in the project was to make sure the registers were keeping track of the data properly and where we wanted it however I did also help Caleb and vice versa. We didn't assign specific parts to eachother we mostly worked on the project piece by piece either on our own or in collaboration during the lab time. We gained a better understanding on how much work it is to make for what seems like such a simple game for people is actually difficult to integrate on a computer. We used our lab resources FPGA board, Quartus Prime, QuestaSim. We also used blocks we made in previous labs to not have to start from scratch as well and those are included in the repository.
